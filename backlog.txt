* Add feature/timer - counts user run time and appends this to a file + remove invalidTable variable - DONE
* Add feature/obj-oriented - pass pointers rather than repeating code - DONE
* Rename all variables to a more appropriate name - DONE
* Add feature/move-functions-to-header-file - move all functions to header file from .c file - Turns out in my case it would be slightly pointless.
* Add feature/display-best-time - displays best user run time
