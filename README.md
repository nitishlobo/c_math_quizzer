# Math Quizzer
<h2> Introduction </h2>

<p>
  Some say they are good at maths, other's say its like learning japanese... </br>
  Put yourself to the test and see how well you score! </br>
</p>

<p>
  c-math-quizzer was one of my first c programs. </br>
  It asks its users arithmetic questions, times and scores them. </br>
</p>

<p>
  Though the software is fully functional, </br>
  there is still more work that can be done to improve the project.
</p>

<h2> Run Instructions </h2>
The program can be run by downloading a local copy and double clicking the executable Quizzer.exe </br>
I hope you enjoy this program as much as I have. </br>
Good luck!   :)
