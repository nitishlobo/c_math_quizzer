# Math Quizzer
Some say they are good at maths, other's say its like learning japanese...
Put yourself to the test and see how well you score!

c-math-quizzer was one of my first c programs.
It asks its users arithmetic questions, times and scores them.

Though the software is fully functional,
there is still more work that can be done to improve the project.
The program can be run by downloading a local copy and double clicking the executable Quizzer.exe
I hope you enjoy this program as much as I have. :) Good luck!
